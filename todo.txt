Error message to be left aligned.

New Features
============

Make a clever FileParameter: can use a pull-down for auto-completion (equivalent of tab completion in linux shells).

FileParameter to display message, when the wrong type of file is chosen (e.g. file vs directory, hidden, wrong extension).

Hide the scrollbar when it is not needed, but extra room still allocated for it by tweaking preferred size.
