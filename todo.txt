Task.tidyUp method???
	Use it to close files etc


WorkFoo (Name taken from AS/400 WRKxxx commands)
	This should probably be a separate project from jguifier

	Header contains task parameters
	table shows the results
	footer contains other data (totals etc)
	
	Table data can be sorted by clicking a heading - not part of the Task parameters, but done AFTERWARDS
	
	Object oriented - a bit like Windows power shell?
	Common result objects :
		File
		Database table
		Database row
		crontab entry
		Myth recording
		TV Series
		TV Episode
		git status
		other git stuff (branches, commits etc)
		Pinkwino (will need a REST API)
			Pinkwino instance (so I can list all of my wikis)
			namespace
			wiki Page (List Namespace, List Links, List Related Pages etc)
			Version
		To-do (from FDroid) - forgotten the name of the utility
			groups
			tasks
		To-do text files (one file for each project, using symlinks in a single directory, or just a List of files)

	Persist meta-data such as
		"next episode to watch"
		current git branch?


	Advanced features (coded later)
		Results are a TREE structure, rather than just a list, e.g. allowing for TV Episodes grouped into series
		One window, with multiple tabs, each containing a different result set
			Peal off tabs to make a new top-level window.
			Middle click to create a new tab, left click to replace the current tab with a new GUITask
			Back/Forward button to return to the previous GUITask 

Use Geb for web scraping?
