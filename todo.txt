BUGS
====

Command doesn't list multiple values????

StringChoiceParameters .choice is annoying, as the two parameter version doesn't set the label
	and the 3 parameter version, you end up repeating the code twice.  

New Features
============

Text editor parameter, for editing chunks of code (such as groovy scripts, xml, json etc)
	http://bobbylight.github.io/RSyntaxTextArea/
	(or maybe code it in wrkfoo only, because it might not be sensible for jguifier to use it)???

Allow one parameter to be set without giving its name
	e.g. fileLister.groovy --depth=2 /home/nick
		(where /home/nick will get the value for the --directory parameter.
	Note: -- is the posix standard for aborting parsing flags, and treats the remainder as regular parameters
	So 
		fileLister.groovy --depth=2 -- --depth
	should list the directory called "--depth"


ChoiceParameter as ToggleButtons and/or radio buttons

MultipleChoiceParameter - pick many from a list of options.

Finish javadocs
