Current Task
============

Refactor, introduce TextParameter

BUGS
====

DoubleParameter says "required" when the default value is not in the range, and is corrected by createComponent, but the value
is not set.

Make a clever File input, can use a pull-down for auto-completion (equivalent of tab completion in linux shells).

Make more reusable by
	allowing FileParameter to be used without a TaskPrompter
		create a ParameterContainer class. TaskPrompter uses one or extends it.

	allowing parameters to be embedded in a JPanel, rather than a JFrame.


Error message to be left aligned.

Hide the scrollbar when it is not needed, but extra room still allocated for it by tweaking preferred size.
